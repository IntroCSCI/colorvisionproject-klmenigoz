# Color Accessibility Checker

## Description

Pull the color values from the imported website code provided by the user. These values should be within 0 and 255 (dec). Then tell the user what colors are present, based off of what RGB value each color is mostly made up of, or blended with. Then tell the user what colors there are and which ones may create conflict, if any.
